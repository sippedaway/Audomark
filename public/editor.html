        <h1>
        An introduction
        </h1>
        <p>
        Hiya!! Welcome to your editor. Here you can add artists, albums, rankings and manage your data.
        </p>

        <h2>
        Adding your first album
        </h2>
        <p>
        Use the "+ Add Artist" button to add a new artist. An artist can be removed with the "-" button and albums can be added with the "+" on the right of "Albums".
        </p>

        <h3>
        Manage an album
        </h3>
        <p>
        You can name an added album anything, add your rating in a 1-100 number and the album cover, however there is one thing you need to be aware of!
        </p>

        <h3>Album cover issues, also known as CORS</h3>
        <p>When choosing your albums' covers, make sure to use good and trusted sources. Many image sources block Cross-Origin Resource Sharing, or better known as CORS.</p>
        <p>This leads to album images not being visible when you export them. This is not a big issue, but one to be aware of.</p>
        <p>Recommended album cover sources include: Spotify, Wikipedia, various streaming services. Do NOT use: magazines, album review pages, news websites.</p>

        <h3>How do I change album order?</h3>
        <p>We suggest you keep your artists' albums in the release order. On the left of each album, use the Grab button to drag albums up and down to change the order.</p>  

        <h2>Managing several artists</h2>
        <p>So artists are automatically sorted on the website, so there is NO need to worry about sorting artists or making a certain order. On the home page, using the "Sort:" dropdown, you can choose between Alphabetical and an Average Rating artist sorting.

        <h3>
        How does sorting work?
        </h3>
        <p><b>Alphabetical:</b> your artists are sorted from A to Z based on the English alphabet.</p>
        <p><b>By ratings:</b> your artists are sorted based on a simple and fair calculation system. The artists albums' rankings (above 0) are all put into artist points.However, you can always change how it is being calculated in your settings.</p>

        <h2>
        Editor errors
        </h2>
        <p>
        If you are experiencing errors with the 'Save' function, we are probably working on an update to our authentication and/or saving system. Please try again later- a fix is soon to come!</p>

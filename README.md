# [Audomark](https://audomark.sipped.org/)
Rank and manage your music in one place.

#### Repository note
No backend code was imported to the repository for security reasons

### What is Audomark?
Audomark is a website where you can add and rank your listened-to music. Here's how it works!

#### Simple editor
With the simple editor, anyone can add as many artists and albums as possible! Then, rank all albums from 0 to 100. This will create a personal statistics page and let you dynamically see what music you like the most, and with one click share it with others!
#### Manage everything
Change how you'd like your top artists to be calculated, how you want to sort artists, and more... Just visit the Settings.
#### Authentication
Uses Google or Discord oAuth2, so I don't have to manage accounts and passwords, ugh :)

### Development
Made by sipped in under a month in December 2024 - January 2025. Made with HTML/CSS/JavaScript + express/node.js and is currently hosted on [audomark.sipped.org](https://audomark.sipped.org) (or sipped.org/audomark)

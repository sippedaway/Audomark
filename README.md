# [Audomark](https://audomark.sipped.org/)
Rank and manage your music in one place. Keep and share your favorite artists, albums together with a simple statistics system that includes pie charts and artist ratings. Back out and download your data any time to keep offline.

### What is Audomark?
Audomark is a website where you can add and rank your listened-to music. Here's how it works!

#### Simple editor
With the simple editor, anyone can add as many artists and albums as possible! Then, rank all albums from 0 to 100. This will create a personal statistics page and let you dynamically see what music you like the most, and with one click share it with others!
#### Share / export / statistics
Always keep an eye on your top artists, albums, and more with the statistics page. Statistics include how many albums & artists you've rated, a pie chart of the ratings you put, an average album rating, top 10 albums, fun things, and artist ratings. At any time export your albums and artists as an image and share with anyone, if you've got friends! Well. Or hang it up on your wall, cool right?
#### Manage everything
Change how you'd like your top artists to be calculated, how you want to sort artists, and more... Just visit the Settings. 
#### Authentication
Uses a simple session ID system with Google and Discord oAuth2. Currently no username-password sign up method, fortunately or not. If you want to have offline access, please [contact](mailto:hello@sipped.org) me and I'll be sure to add an offline mode, even including a self-hosting download.
